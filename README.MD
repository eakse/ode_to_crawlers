**Project to expand on my python skills.**
--
Idea is to create a dungeon crawler in the vein of the old-school crawler Demise.

I'm using JSON for most of the data sources. Sofar all the classes I use can load/save to JSON.

Currently using tKinter for the mapping app.

Planning to use panda3d for the actual game itself...
